== About me

I received a B.S. in mathematics from Hunan University in 2013. I got my PhD degree in 2018, under the supervision of Professor [http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~dyh/ Yu-Hong Dai] in [http://english.amss.cas.cn/ Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science] of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was a postdoctoral fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the mentorship of Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/xjchen/ChenXJ.htm Xiaojun Chen] during October 2018 to October 2019. Now I am a postdoctoral fellow, working with Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/pong/ Ting Kei Pong] at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
