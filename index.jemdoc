I received my Bachelor degree in 2013 from the [http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm Hunan University], School of Mathematics. I got my PhD degree in June 2018, under the supervision of Professor [http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~dyh/ Yu-Hong Dai] in [http://english.amss.cas.cn/ Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science] of [http://english.cas.cn/ Chinese Academy of Sciences]. From October 2018 to October 2019, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ The Hong Kong Polytechnic University], under the mentorship of Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/xjchen/ChenXJ.htm Xiaojun Chen]. Now I am a postdoctoral fellow, working with Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/pong/ Ting Kei Pong] at [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ The Hong Kong Polytechnic University].
