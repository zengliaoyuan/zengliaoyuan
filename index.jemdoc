== About me

I received a B.S. in mathematics from [http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm Hunan University] in 2013. I got my PhD degree in 2018, under the supervision of Professor [http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~dyh/ Yu-Hong Dai] in [http://english.amss.cas.cn/ Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science] of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was a postdoctoral fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the mentorship of Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/xjchen/ChenXJ.htm Xiaojun Chen] during October 2018 to October 2019. From January 2020 to September 2022, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/pong/ Ting Kei Pong] at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am currently an assistant professor at [http://www.lxy.zjut.edu.cn/ College of Science], [http://www.zjut.edu.cn/main.htm Zhejiang University of Technology].
